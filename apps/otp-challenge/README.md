# OTP Challenge

Create an otp input field with these UX requirements:
1) in each tile the user can write a number between 0 and 9
2) when the user writes the number, next tile should be focused
3) user can edit only the focused tile
4) if the last tile is focused and a value is set, the user can't edit any tile
